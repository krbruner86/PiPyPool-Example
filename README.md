# PiPyPool-Example
These are selected files from a project utilizing the Raspberry Pi and Atlas Scientific circuits to control pool water. The complete codebase is in working order and can control the chlorine and pH levels of a pool. The Raspberry Pi interfaces with 2 relays to switch on 120v circuits that pump chlorine and acid into the pool.

I began this project when I was learning how to code and before I decided to begin my formal education in Computer Science.

# Technologies Used
The main program is written Python 3, along with a RethinkDB database, and socket-io for real-time updates to a webpage.

# Disclaimer
These selected files are used to showcase a large working project. I have not been able to work on this project for a few years and it is in no way a reflection of my current knowledge and skills as a developer.

I hope to be able to have time soon to pick the project back up and update it with new technologies and display my growth as a developer.
